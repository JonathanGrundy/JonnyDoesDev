HTML is the very first and basic step of web development. It is the thing that Tim Berners Lee created and is the standard now across all websites, although there have been updates done along the way. 

It stands for Hypertext Markup Language and it consists of many 'tags' which is what gives us a basic webpage with functions such as different pages, pictures and forms.
