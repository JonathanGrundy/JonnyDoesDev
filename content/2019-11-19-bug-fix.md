## Issue Loading Picture

I tried to upload my photo to the end of each of my posts and there seemed to be an issue when i came to loading it live, compared to when i uploaded the page locally. What i had to do was to try and figure out as to why it wouldn't load on the live online page.

I realised after searching through the code that under the gitignore file the public build file had been placed into it meaning that the file would not open on a live site. I resolved it by deleting that out of the gitignore file and saving then refreshing.
