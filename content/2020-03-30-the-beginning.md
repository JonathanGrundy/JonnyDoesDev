<p>Today i decided to revisit the website i initially set up in November 2019. It has been created using Gatsby which is a React based site generator. The reason for me using this is that it will help introduce me to new technologies such as React and Javascript so i can nagivate similar code in the future. </p>

<p>I am going to be doing The Complete Web Developer 2020: Zero to Mastery, instructed by Andrei Neagoie. The page is going to be what i am learning on a day to day basis and anything that i might learn/do on the side of it. </p>
