HTML is the very first and basic step of web development. It is the thing that Tim Berners Lee created and is the standard now across all websites, although there have been updates done along the way. 

It stands for Hypertext Markup Language and it consists of many 'tags' which is what gives us a basic webpage with functions such as different pages, pictures and forms. 

In this section i have completed 3 different html documents. They are a basic webpage, a list and a form. 

I feel that forms are the most essential part of the html course as it is something that is used on pretty much any website that you sign up to.
