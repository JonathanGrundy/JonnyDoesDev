Part of my CSS course showed my how to create flexbox. Which is a way to display photos or a box on the webpage that is responsive to the site. 

It was quite easy to produce because all you have to do it create a separate css file, wrap everything that you want into the box into a `div` container and put in 'display: flex;` to activate flexbox. You then add wrap as a style and what i did was the center the page. 

This can be done with pictures or tiles, whatever you want in a box.
