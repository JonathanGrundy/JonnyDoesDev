Today i learnt Bootstrap and Mailchimp and created a landing page.

Bootstrap is different components you can use on your own website without having to write the code yourself. 

You can either download Bootstrap or just use scripts and link it to your website. 

There are many different components that you can add to your own website that can be tailored to your own needs. All you need to do is take the code from the desired component and ensure the script gets added via a link and copy and paste that into your code. 

You then create a CSS page and add your own design to it. 

I also learnt about Mailchimp, which is a website where you create a page where users can enter their email addresses and sign up to your site. 

It was very simple to complete. It was a case of following their site set up and then linking it to your code via a link tag.
