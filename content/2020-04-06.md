Today i spoke to a friend who is already a full stack developer working in London. We discussed my future ambitions and how i was learning to become a full stack developer. After an extensive conversion he offered to be a mentor to me. We decided that we would create an app using React. I haven't really looked at much React yet but think this would be a good opportunity to learn the language as i will have his help with anything i may struggle with.
