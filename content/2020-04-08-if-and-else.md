If and else are conditional Javascript statements. 

There are 3 types of statements and they are `if`, `else` and `if else`. These are used to control the flow of the programs execution based upon conditions known only during run time.

Firstly if statements are the simplest of statements. It is used to decide whether a certain input or block of inputs will be executed or not. For example if a user enters their login details correctly then the operation will run. But if not it will revert back. 

Then there are `else` statements. These are utilised in the same way as `if` statements but what this will do is bring up an error message if the input from the user is false. 

And finally there are `if-else` statements. These can be used if there are multiple users. For example a user tries to log in and the Javascript doesn't recognise their log in details it will then go to the next person on the list and then "check" that one to ensure that this person is able to login the website.
