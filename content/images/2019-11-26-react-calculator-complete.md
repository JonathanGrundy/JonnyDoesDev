##React Calculator complete

So today i completed my calculator using React. I did it using a youtube tutorial and found it to be helpful building something from scratch as well as seeing how different components on a page come together.

Although i built the calculator using a tutorial i am now going to go through some of different tags to try and decipher what each of them are and how i can use them on other websites.
