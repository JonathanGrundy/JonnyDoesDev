		<p>A little about myself:</p>

<p>I have been in retail for 10 years working from a part time shelf stacker to a manager of over 30 people, navigating throught 3 respectable UK companies.
Once i heard about web development in August 2019 i tried out a couple of courses and was immediately hooked. That month i quit my position in retail and started to spend serious time 
learning more about it. During that same month i found out that my wife fell pregnant and i knew that i needed to get a job to provide for our growing family. 
Now that we have had our little baby boy i have managed to put aside all other work again and concentrate on my learning. 
This website has been created using Gatsby to document my development in web development and something i can refer back to if i get stuck in the future. </p>
