		<p>A little about myself:</p>

<p>A brief pen-picture about me:



I previously worked in the retail sector and did so for 10 years. I started my retail life by working as a week-end part-time shelf-stacker. I then variously progressed via three large, nationally well-known companies, becoming a Store Manager supervising in excess of 40 staff. 



I was made aware of web development in August 2019 and out of interest (fuelled by my specialism in one of my retail roles) I tried out a couple of courses to determine what it entailed – I was immediately hooked! 



That month I made the decision to leave my position in retail, and started to spend serious time learning more about web-development and more about what I would need to become proficient. 



During that same month, I found out that my wife was pregnant with our first child. I then knew that I needed to be able to get a job to provide for our growing family.

Now that we have had our baby boy I have fortunately managed to put aside all other work, which allows me to concentrate fully on developing my skills and abilities in my new sphere of learning. 



I have created this website by using “Gatsby”, which enables me to document my personal progress and my enhancement in web development practices. I can also use it as a reference point to look back upon when I need further clarification or reminders on how to deal with a particular topic or problem. 



Throughout the course I will be uploading every piece of work that I complete. I will do this onto “Github”, and it will be readily available from the link below. </p>
